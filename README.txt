Code underlying the analyses of following publication:
Hausmann AE, Kuo C-Y, Freire M, Rueda-M N, Linares M, Pardo-Diaz C, Salazar C, Merrill RM. 2021 Light environment influences mating behaviours during the early stages of divergence in tropical butterflies. Proc. R. Soc. B 288, 20210157. (doi:10.1098/rspb.2021.0157)

Analyses_and_Data: Contains all data used for the analyses (folder "Data"). The code underlying the analysis is in the folder "Markdown", in the Rmd document Hausmann_et_al_2021_Markdown.Rmd. The HTML document which this Rmd produces is in the supplementary material of our manuscript. This markdown relies on outsourced functions defined in other_plot_functions.R and Plot_Proportion_Stats.R, found in the folder "Skripts_called_from_Markdown". Check out the Markdown for more detailed explanations (also explanations on the different columns of the data sheets)!
Motion_detection_pipeline: All necessary code to build our motion-detection pipeline (written for Windows). Mind that to make the pipeline work, you have to follow quite a complex process of installation. This is all described in detail in the README in the subdirectory Motion_detection_pipeline. More details on how to install OpenCV are also given in the .md files in the subdirectory Frame_Detection_OpenCV. This folder contains two subfolders. Software for motion detection (used in this manuscript) or alternatively software for colour detection. Under directory Motion_detection_pipeline\OpenCV_Code\MovementIntoFrame you can find the motion detection code used for this manuscript, MovementIntoFrame.cpp.
