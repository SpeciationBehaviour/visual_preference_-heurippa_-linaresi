Directory created in July 2020 by A.E. Hausmann (alexander_hausmann@gmx.net)

Analyses_and_Data: Contains all data used for the analyses (folder "Data"). The code underlying the analysis is in the folder "Markdown", in the Rmd document Hausmann_et_al_2020_Markdown.Rmd. This markdown relies on outsourced functions defined in other_plot_functions.R and Plot_Proportion_Stats.R, found in the folder "Skripts_called_from_Markdown". The HTML document which this Rmd produces is in the supplementary material of our manuscript. Check out the Markdown for more detailed explanations (also explanations on the different columns of the data sheets)!
Motion_detection_pipeline: All necessary code to build our motion-detection pipeline (written for Windows). Mind that to make the pipeline work, you have to follow quite a complex process of installation. This is all described in detail in the README in the subdirectory Motion_detection_pipeline. More details on how to install OpenCV are also given in the .md files in the subdirectory Frame_Detection_OpenCV. This folder contains two subfolders. Software for motion detection (used in this manuscript) or alternatively software for colour detection. Under directory Motion_detection_pipeline\OpenCV_Code\MovementIntoFrame you can find the motion detection code used for this manuscript, MovementIntoFrame.cpp.
